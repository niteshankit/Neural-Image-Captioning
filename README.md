Image captioning is a task very close to the heart of scene description, as it connects both research communities of computer vision and natural language processing. A three years old kid is already proficient at one very significant task: To have a sense of what they see, yet our most advanced computers still struggle at this job. CCTV cameras are present almost at every place, but they do not alert us while a child is drowning in a swimming pool. Technology is that much advanced these days, but we have yet not delivered sight to the blind, instead we are busy in making remarkable megapixels of cameras. So, can conclude that weâ€™re very much blind considering our whole society, as our smartest machines are still blind. Ultimately, our target is to teach the machines to see the same as we do. To accomplish this task of Image captioning, various algorithms are being proposed by researchers that integrate into an effective CNN plus RNN image captioning model.
